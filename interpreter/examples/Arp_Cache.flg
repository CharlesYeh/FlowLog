/*
 * A simple ARP proxy with cache.
 *
 * All ARP requests are sent to the controller (except those issued by the
 * controller, of course). The controller attempts to reply to them from its
 * cache. If the mapping is not found in the cache, then the controller issues
 * its own ARP request to answer the original. We don't want to issue more
 * than one ARP request to any given host, thus we keep a queue of outstanding
 * requests which we are actively proxying.
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - Implement with soft state. Requires timeouts and enables updates.
 *  - Replace controller MAC and IP addresses & arp_op with constants
 *    (requires FlowLog improvements).
